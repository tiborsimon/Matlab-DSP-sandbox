function [f,U]=Spectrum_Analyser(t,v,f1,f2,delta);
%This program operates as a signal spectrum analyzer 
%and a distortion meter at the same time.
%It can accept any numerical data representing few cycles of a signal.
%The data do not need to be equally separated. 
%At least ten data points per cycle are needed. 
%Higher number of data points will of course produce better results. 
%The main advantage of the program is its ability to
%automatically detect the fundamental frequency. 
%Any part of the spectrum within the frequency band f1-f2 
%can be calculated and plotted. 
%The input to the software are the time and signal
%voltage arrays t,v, the frequency band 
%limits f1 and f2 and the accuracy parameter delta. 
%The out puts of the program are the signal plot, 
%the spectral analysis plot, the frequencies and relative 
%amplitudes of the ten most prominent frequency contents. 
%The software has been successfully used to analyze data 
%obtained from oscilloscope screen pictures of many 
%signals using another program written by the author called oscilloscope. 
%The program can be called through entering
%[F,A]=spectrum_analysis(t,v,f1,f2,0.001)
